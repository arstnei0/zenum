A better enum for simplicity and typesafety.

## About
The source code has only 36 lines (with prettier)!

The project [TS Pattern](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern) which is quite similar to Zenum is great, but it's not simply enough and sometimes its syntax is way trivial. For some simple usages (also in most cases), Zenum is enough and TS Pattern is too big and superfluous. But for more complex uses, I still recommend you to use TS Pattern which is undoubtedly well designed and implemented. Nonetheless, you won't need TS Pattern's big system in most cases.
